# Milestone3
The goal of this weeks Milestone assignment was to incorporate the coding language CSS into our webpage. We were to do this by using various different styles and techniques. We were also told that we needed to incororate CSS tags to support animations as well as CSS transitions into our code. We were asked to use various different text fonts, colors, border, and page background.
Added various CSS code both external as well as internal. I added various different elements as well as techniques.
I have also added comments inside the code as asked in the guide.
